## FAQ

- **Do you collect any data from the user?**

* No, Every functionality of the extension is implemented in the extension itself, it does not make any network request to any third party servers. The extension does not use any third party tracking tool [google analytics] either. All external network requests are made to **api.evaly.com.bd** domain.
